                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Well, to be completely honest, the sum total of this website is who I have been for the last year. I spend the majority of my time
                        teaching myself new languages and frameworks. People often tell me, "your youth should be the most fun", and I agree to some extent, but hardwork tomorrow does not pay off today,
                        so ive learned to take advantage of this young brain to study now. Dont get me wrong, this is hardly a sacrifice. I enjoy this! I live alone with
                        my cat Raja and work two jobs at separate hotels. If I ever truly feel burnt out ill make sure to grab some good food and watch a documentary, but other
                        than that, I make sure to stay on top of my current curriculum. As far as education goes, im currently a student at the Universit of North Florida
                        taking courses to obtain a bachelors in computer science, although I will be switching to a different university soon, but the degree will be the same!
